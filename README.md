## Evaluating MDM products



$${\color{red}NOTE!}$$ 
> Check out the new format of the [MDM Comparison Table](https://github.com/hkystar35/MDM/blob/dev/Apple/MDM%20Comparison%20Table.md) in the `dev` branch. Please [create a new PR](https://github.com/hkystar35/MDM/pull/new/dev) to correct or add any items, MDMs, or add supporting documentation links.

If you're lucky (unlucky?) enough to get to choose an MDM product for your organization, whether starting new or migrating from an existing one, you need to figure out what your true needs are.

Being prepared to make concessions on superflous items while holding firm on high-priority features is a delicate balance. Ultimately, most admins will have to balance cost, functionality, and learning curve.
