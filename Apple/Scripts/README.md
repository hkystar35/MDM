# Scripts
Notes on some of these scripts, mostly steps to setup in Jamf Pro

## [set-proxyVariables.zsh](set-proxyVariables.zsh)

Proxies are rarely fun to deal with, especially when pairing them high-security setups to limit admin-level permissions to nearly all aspects of macOS, which prevents users from many self-help options.
Because of this, I set out to script a way to set your proxy information by script using an MDM, in this case Jamf.
My goals were:
1) Flexible.
   - Needs to be easily changeable. In case hosts or URLs change, being able to quikcly modify only a parameter and not the core script makes changes faster and more predictable.
2) Easy to deploy.
   - Deploying via MDM is the easiest and most reliable option. Jamf's script runner is great and allows for parameters to be labeled and modified within a policy without modifying the script directly.
3) Non-invasive.
   - Will not interrupt any existing connections (open Terminal windows). Also, if an OS update clears out the system shell profile, the settings won't throw errors when opening a Terminal.
4) Easy to remove (or ensure missing info didn't break connections).
   - Avoid having to remove lines from a system shell profile at all costs. Instead, only *add* a one-liner to check for a settings file and source it if exists.

Check the comment block in the script for params.
I cannot share screenshots at this time, sorry.

## [install-or-update-sentinelone.zsh](install-or-update-sentinelone.zsh)

With help from [Willk675](https://macadmins.slack.com/team/U03FJURNFNU) to get it started, I expanded to make this script more verbose, add an installation piece, and support for Jamf Pro's script parameter variables.

### Jamf Pro Setup
1) In Settings > Scripts > click **New +**
    * General -> Name it
    * Script -> Paste contents
    * Options -> label variables 4-6 (see script contents for suggestion)
**Save**

2) In Computers > Policies > click **New +**
    * General -> name what you want, triggers, etc.
    * Packages
        * Select your uploaded SentinelOne package
        * Make sure to select **Cache** 
        * Copy the package name text
    * Scripts
        * Select the script you created in Step 1
        * Set parameter values
            * Paste the package name, version, and token as necessary

Configure the rest how you want (scope, maintenance, etc.)

Deploy and you should only have to deploy 1 policy to all targeted machines to update or install the agent.

## [set-defaultDock.bash](set-defaultDock.bash)

This script leverages [Dockutil](https://github.com/kcrawford/dockutil) to set the currently logged-in Mac user's Dock items.

### Jamf Pro Setup (recommended approach)
1) In Settings > Scripts > click **New +**
    * General -> Name it
    * Script -> Paste contents
    * Options -> label variables 4-6 (see script contents for suggestion)
**Save**
        * I only have Option 4 set for installing Dockutil using a Jamf Pro Policy item's Custom Event trigger. Customize as you se fit.

2) In Computers > Policies > click **New +**
    * General -> name what you want, triggers, etc.
        * Trigger
            * Custom: `set-defaultdock`
        * Execution Frequency: Ongoing
    * Scripts
        * Select the script you created in Step 1
        * Set parameter values, if needed
    * Scope
        * All Computers or a Smart Group for all computers
    * Self Service
        * I like to make this available in Self Service in case users ever want to reset their Dock quickly

3) Add Policy from Step 2 to your Enrollment setup (DEPNotify, Jamf Setup Manager, SUPER, Octory, etc)
    * Have it run last after all apps are installed and Mac is at the user's desktop
